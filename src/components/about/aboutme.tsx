            With more than 3+ years of experience building complex interfaces, I'm happy to deliver anything from single-page apps to scaleable 
            design systems. I combine nuanced timing and motion with a deep understanding of browser rendering to deliver logical interactions that 
            are both full of character and outrageously smooth. Beyond front-end development, I am passionate about API and database development, 
            currently expanding my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, React, Java, Python, and Spring Boot. Recently awarded the PearlHacks Winner accolade for <a href="https://devpost.com/software/publiceye-8b9qew" target="_blank">PublicEye</a>, 
            a groundbreaking project enhancing civic engagement.

        All that said, if you are looking for help building something that promotes sustainability, diversity, 
        or generally aims to make a positive impact, then letâ€™s talk.
